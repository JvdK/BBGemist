BBGemist (Blackboard Downloader)
================================
The goal of this program is to download course data from the University of Twente Blackboard archive, which
is available until 14 September 2020. It tries to download all course files, assignments and submissions available.
The web pages will be scraped and modified to work without a web-server to create a local Blackboard copy.
